# HearthLight for Home Assistant

The HearthLight design system as a Home Assistant integration: a warm, ember-and-slate theme plus theme-adaptive brand marks for your dashboards — installed, updated, and kept as your default automatically.

- **Theme** — Ember Orange `#fc7114` + Slate `#253540` with warm Sand light surfaces, automatic light/dark via `modes`, device-native system fonts.
- **Default-theme management** — HearthLight is re-applied as the backend default (light + dark) on every Home Assistant start. No startup automation needed.
- **Brand card** — `custom:hearthlight-brand` inlines the HearthLight SVG marks and maps their colors to theme variables, so they adapt to light/dark exactly like text.
- **Served assets** — all brand SVGs are available under `/hearthlight/brand/` for picture cards, markdown, or anything else.

## Installation (HACS)

1. HACS → three-dots menu → **Custom repositories** → add `mjg913/HearthLight-HASS-Integration` as an **Integration**.
2. Download **HearthLight**, restart Home Assistant.
3. Settings → Devices & Services → **Add integration** → HearthLight.

That's it — the theme is installed to `themes/hearthlight/hearthlight.yaml` and set as the backend default.

### Themes include

Theme loading requires a themes include in `configuration.yaml` (the integration raises a Repair issue if it's missing):

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The integration owns `themes/hearthlight/hearthlight.yaml`. Local edits to that file are overwritten on every update — the theme's source of truth is this repository. To hand-manage the theme, turn off **Manage the theme file** in the integration options.

## Brand card

Fully configurable in the visual card editor (search for "HearthLight Brand" in the card picker), or via YAML:

```yaml
type: custom:hearthlight-brand
asset: combination-mark      # combination-mark | combination-mark-2 | wordmark | wordmark-2
color_mode: theme            # theme | brand | mono | custom
height: 96px                 # any CSS length
alignment: center            # start | center | end
plain: false                 # true = bare logo, no card background/padding
```

Set `plain: true` to render just the mark with no card chrome — like the markdown card's `text_only` — for placing the logo inline on a dashboard without a visible card.

| `color_mode` | Wordmark (slate role) | Flame (ember role) |
|---|---|---|
| `theme` (default) | `--primary-text-color` | `--primary-color` |
| `brand` | `--primary-text-color` | always `#fc7114` |
| `mono` | `--primary-text-color` | `--primary-text-color` |
| `custom` | `colors.slate` | `colors.flame` |

`custom` example:

```yaml
type: custom:hearthlight-brand
asset: wordmark-2
color_mode: custom
colors:
  slate: var(--accent-color)
  flame: "#f5a623"
```

## Static brand assets

Every mark ships in COLOR (light backgrounds), and where available DARK (all-slate) and WHITE (dark backgrounds) variants:

```
/hearthlight/brand/combination-mark-{color,dark,white}.svg
/hearthlight/brand/combination-mark-2-{color,dark}.svg
/hearthlight/brand/wordmark-{color,dark}.svg
/hearthlight/brand/wordmark-2-{color,dark,white}.svg
```

These render with their baked-in colors (no theme adaptation) — use the card for adaptive rendering.

## Options

Settings → Devices & Services → HearthLight → **Configure**:

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Manage the theme file | on | Install/overwrite the theme on setup and updates |
| Set HearthLight as the backend default theme | on | Re-apply on every HA start |
| Register the brand card dashboard resource | on | Auto-register `hearthlight-brand-card.js` |

### YAML dashboards

With YAML-mode dashboards the resource can't be registered automatically; the card is loaded globally instead and a Repair issue suggests adding it to your Lovelace config:

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /hearthlight/hearthlight-brand-card.js
      type: module
```

## Removal

Deleting the integration removes the dashboard resource, deletes `themes/hearthlight/`, and resets the backend default theme to Home Assistant's default.
